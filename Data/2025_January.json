During the first six months of life, he experienced feeding difficulties due to a thin esophagus, requiring reconstructive surgery at 10 months of age. Following the surgery, he developed seizures that recurred over 10 days, after which he was started on anti-seizure medications. Chromosomal microarray analysis (done elsewhere; 2024) revealed a normal chromosomal complement but identified multiple regions of homozygosity (ranging from 14.5 to 33.7 Mb) across chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6, 13, 18, and 22, suggesting a potential autosomal recessive etiology. Fragile X screening (done elsewhere; 2024) showed a CGG repeat size of 29, which falls within the normal range. Proband, Master Mohamed Daniyal has been evaluated for pathogenic variations.",

Her brother's DCDA twins conceived by ART presented with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, neurodevelopment regression, language delay, extensor plantar reflex, red reflex, increased tone in both ankles, calf hypertrophy. Whole exome sequencing (done elsewhere, 2023) was indicative of homozygous variant of uncertain significance PLA2G6: c.985C>T in both twin, and a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance NBEA: c.7001T>C. Mrs. Vaishali has bilateral renal non-obstructive calculi and right ovarian simple cyst. Semen Analysis in the Male partner revealed normozoospermia. Peripheral blood karyotyping in both the partners revealed normal chromosome complement. Mr. Vivekanandan and Mrs. Vaishali V have been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations.",
