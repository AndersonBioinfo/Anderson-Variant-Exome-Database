Extended\ncarrier screening in the female partner (2018, done elsewhere) revealed heterozygous pathogenic variant\nBTD:c.1330G>C. Spinal Muscular Atrophy mutation analysis, screening for Fragile X syndrome and tay-sachs\ndisease in female partner (2018, done elsewhere) revealed no pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants;\nnormal. Genetic thrombophilia panel for recurrent pregnancy loss (2024, done at Anderson Diagnostics and\nLabs) for the female partner revealed a heterozygous polymorphism MTHFR: c.1298A>C and a homozygous\n4G/4G polymorphism in PAI-1 4G/5G. Mr. Surendra Kanth Reddy and Mrs. G. Suma have been evaluated\nfor comprehensive carrier screening of pathogenic variations.Mr. Komal Kumar M.K and Mrs. Sharvani Bai S.R are non-consanguineous couple. They were presented with history of previous pregnancy terminated as TIFFA scan at 21 weeks GA was indicative of Arnold Chiari Malformation (ACM) type II with open spina bifida, mild kyphoscoliosis, bilateral hydrocephalus and lumbar myelomeningocele. Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (done at Medgenome Labs) in the Product of Conception revealed no copy number variations. Hb-electrophoresis in female partner revealed beta thalassemia trait (carrier). Female partner's sister was clinically diagnosed with beta thalassemia and succumbed at 4 years of age. Mr. Komal Kumar and Mrs. Sharvani Bai have been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations.",
