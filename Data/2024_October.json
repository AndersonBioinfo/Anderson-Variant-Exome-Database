ANA profile in female partner was indicative of weak positive. Factor VIII (anti-hemophilia A) activity in female partner was indicative of reduced activity of 26% (reference range: 50-150). Semen analysis (2021) and sperm DNA fragmentation (2021) in male partner revealed teratozoospermia and 23% DFI. Mr. S. Phani Suresh and Mrs. S. Anusha have been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations.",
