She has a history of swelling over left axilla at 6 months of age following BCG vaccination ?BCG lymphadenitis. At 5 years of age had multiple reddish lesions in the lower limbs. Multiple non blanching, non-palpable bright red to dull erythematous purpura involving the foot, leg and few lesions over the thigh. Skin biopsy showed vasculopathic changes suggestive of resolving/impending vasculitis and had elevated IgE and IgG. Clinical Exome Sequencing (done elsewhere) was indicative of homozygous pathogenic variant c.1561C>T and homozygous variant of uncertain significance c.1492G>T in IL12RB1 gene causing Immunodeficiency 30. Their second born male child had respiratory infection, diagnosed with Tuberculosis and succumbed to illness at three months of age. Mr. Visuvasam and Mrs. Rubi have been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations.",

Krabbe disease deletion/duplication analysis by MLPA (2021, done at Medgenome Labs) in the index child was indicative of No pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. Sanger sequencing (2021, done at Medgenome Labs) in couple was indicative of female partner being heterozygous (asymptomatic) for the variant c.1400C>A in GALC gene and the variant is absent in the male partner. Exome sequencing (2022, done at Kasturba medical College) in the index child for GALC gene was indicative of heterozygous likely pathogenic variant c.1400C>A and a heterozygous Variant of Uncertain significance c.1338+16A>G in GALC gene associated with Krabbe disease (AR). Segregation analysis and validation by Sanger sequencing confirmed the carrier status of variants in his parents. Mrs. Gouthami and Mr. Rajeshwar Rao P have been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations.",

Their first pregnancy resulted in stillbirth of female fetus at 33 weeks GA. Ultrasound scan at 31 weeks GA is indicative of asymmetrical IUGR, moderate degree of polyhydramnios with features of arthrogryposis multiplexa and associated non-immune hydrous. Fetal MRI is indicative of bilateral pleural effusion with partial flexion at all joints suggestive of fetal hypokinesia/akinesia/arthrogryposis multiplexa. Post birth examination revealed macerated skin peeling, micrognathia, hypertelorism, large philtrum, depressed nose, contractures at bilateral elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle joints, generalised edema, multiple bulbous lesions, and club foot. Muscle biopsy showed neurological atrophy, possibility of anterior horn cell disease-? Spino Muscular Atrophy. Fetal autopsy revealed growth appropriate for the gestational age, contractures of limbs, and fracture of right humerus with skin showing grade 3 maceration. Their second pregnancy was terminated at 21 weeks 3 days due to thick nuchal edema, bilateral fetal renal pelviectasia, growth lag by 1 week, left hand hooked index finger, and left talipes equinovarus possibly due to recurrent arthrogryposis multiplexa congenita. FISH and Karyotype (Done elsewhere) in amniotic fluid was done due to high risk for trisomy 21 and increased NT and was indicative of normal chromosome complement. Post-termination male fetus was suspected of low-set ears. Mr. Pavan Kumar and Mrs. Sindhu Pavan have been for carrier status of evaluated for pathogenic variations.",

Karthiga had been presented with clinical indications of pallor, failure to thrive, abdominal swelling, mildly delayed gross motor development, hemangioma in the thigh and has been suspected to be affected with Niemann Pick disease/Tyrosinemia. Her previous examination findings revealed Mangoloid spots and investigations revealed Normochromic anemia. Her USG abdomen results revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Previous Exome sequencing (done elsewhere; dated on: 23.06.2022) revealed an autosomal recessive homozygous pathogenic variant in SMPD1 gene (c. 1624C>T; p. Arg542Ter) associated with Niemann Pick disease. She was suspected to have biliary atresia and Hypophosphatemia related disorders. Baby. Karthiga's reanalysis exome sequencing analysis (done at Anderson Diagnostics and Labs_AND23380120113; 2023) revealed autosomal recessive heterozygous variant of uncertain significance c.894_896delGAA in SLC34A3 gene and autosomal recessive homozygous variant of uncertain significance c.1739G>T in TRMT1 gene. Both the partners has low serum phosphorus levels suggestive of hypophosphatemia. Mr. Ganesh Kumar and Mrs Vaishnavi have been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations.guineous",

Later baby presented with Global Developmental Delay, Bilateral atypical retinitis pigmentosa, stiffness / lethargy, failure to thrive and succumbed to respiratory distress at 8 months of age. MRI Brain was indicative of cerebral atrophy, no white and gray matter lesions. USG Abdomen and pelvis was indicative of hepatosplenomegaly. Skeletal X-ray was indicative of L1 and L2 showing inferior peaking. Baby was suspected to be affected with Mucopolysaccharidosis/Osteopetrosis/GM1, GM2 Gangliosidosis. Whole Exome Sequencing revealed homozygous variant of uncertain significance c.952A>G in POLG2 gene associated Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 16B and homozygous pathogenic deletion in chromosome 16p13.3 associated with Osteopetrosis. Targeted testing in parents revealed they are carriers for the variant c.952A>G in POLG2 gene and Chromosomal Microarray analysis was indicative of no copy number variations. Reanalysis of WES was indicative of likely pathogenic heterozygous variant c.744C>G in GPHN gene associated with Molybdenum cofactor deficiency C and previously reported variant in POLG2 gene. Mr. Vigneshwaran and Mrs. Yuvasri has been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations.",

Mr. Ganesh Raju developed secondary glaucoma and the fundus showed fresh superior rhegmatagenous retinal detachment with macula in the right eye. His left eye showed clear graft with clear lens and normal fundus. The Antinuclear Antibody test analysis indicates sjogren's syndrome / SLE. He is presented with complaints of numbness in both upper and lower limbs. The NCS/EMG/EP of upper and lower limbs is suggestive of sensory-motor neuropathy of lower limbs. His Spinal Muscular Atrophy Deletion Duplication analysis [Done at Anderson Diagnostics & Labs] revealed negative result. The electrophysiological study reveals severe sensory neuropathy of upper limbs, left ulnar neuropathy at the elbow and suggestive of bilateral C8/T1 radiculopathy and on medication since 2022. Mr. Ganesh Raju has been evaluated for the pathogenic variations.",

Her second pregnancy resulted in the pre-term delivery of a female child and was suspected to have succumbed due to respiratory distress syndrome and low birth weight at day 1 of life. Her third pregnancy's antenatal scan at 23 weeks GA was indicative of features suggestive of bilateral pyelectasia with fetal hydroureteronephrosis and delivered a male child and postnatal scan on day 1 of life showed right renal severe hydrouretronephrosis with no obstructive cause likely due to reflux and was diagnosed with neonatal cholestasis and biliary atresia and succumbed at 9 months of life. The couple's Peripheral Blood Karyotyping (Done elsewhere) is indicative of a normal chromosome complement. Mrs. Mahalakshmi has been evaluated for pathogenic variations.",
