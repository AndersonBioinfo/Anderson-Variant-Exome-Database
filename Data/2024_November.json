Whole exome sequencing with mitochondrial genome sequencing (done elsewhere, 2021) identified a homozygous likely pathogenic variant, c.1018G>A, in the LONP1 gene, associated with LONP1-related mitochondrial ciliopathy. During the couple's second pregnancy, prenatal sanger (done elsewhere, 2024) revealed the presence of variant c.1018G>A, in the LONP1 gene in homozygous state. Mr. Samrat Keshari Mishra and Mrs. Suchithra have been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations",

      "Clinical History": "Mr. Swamy and Mrs. B Srividya are of second-degree consanguineous marriage. They were presented with history of three first trimester spontaneous abortions and her previous pregnancy (G4; conceived through ART) was terminated due to Intrauterine fetal demise with cystic hygroma, at 16 weeks GA. Extended QF-PCR and 750k Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (AND24420006667, 2024) in the Product of Conception revealed normal diploid complement/ no significant copy number variations. Whole exome sequencing (AND24420006667, 2024) in the Product of Conception revealed a homozygous Variant of Uncertain Significance in RYR1 gene (c.12479A>T; p.His4160Leu) associated with congenital myopathy 1B, autosomal recessive. Additionally a homozygous Variant of Uncertain Significance in COQ8A gene (c.1090G>A; p.Val364Met) associated with Coenzyme Q10 deficiency, primary, 4 (AR) and two heterozygous likely pathogenic variants in DGKE gene (c.231C>A; p.Cys77Ter) associated with Hemolytic uremic syndrome, atypical, susceptibility to, 7 / Nephrotic syndrome, type 7 (AR) and LIPA gene (c.894G>A; p.Gln298=) associated with Cholesteryl ester storage disease/ Wolman disease (AR) have been reported. Mr. Swamy and Mrs. B Srividya have been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations.",
