His antenatal scan revealed hypoplastic nasal bone. FISH and Chromosomal Microarray Analysis in the Amniotic fluid (Done elsewhere, 2019) revealed no aneuploidies and significant copy number variations detected respectively. Admission to NICU was done due to neonatal jaundice and pyloric stenosis. He presented with abnormal social behaviour, autism, behavioural abnormality, decreased serum creatinine, delayed speech and language development, developmental regression, hyperactivity, increased MCV, increased serum lactate, language impairment, decreased vitamin D. His BERA test revealed mild to moderate hearing loss of right ear. Exome sequencing (Done elsewhere, 2023) revealed two variant of uncertain significance KDM4B: c.2642C>T causative of Autosomal Dominant Intellectual Disability Disorder type 65; KMT2E: c.4897C>T causative of O’ Donnell-Luria-Rodan Syndrome, one pathogenic variant LDLR: c.718G>A causative of Familial Hypercholesteremia and one likely pathogenic variant DYPS: c.1010T>C causative of Dihydropyrimidinuria.

His Romberg test revealed initially swayed backwards and generally did not seem steady. His Optic fundi revealed sharp disc margins and the visual fields are full on confrontation testing. His MRI brain showed abnormalities in cerebellum (reports unavailable). Mrs. Likitha was diagnosed with bilateral polycystic ovaries. Male partner's sister has similar presentations of ataxia and walks with support of crutches. Friedreich Ataxia repeat expansion analysis for Mr. Shiva Karthik (AND24480018830, 2024) revealed negative for Trinucleotide repeat expansion in FXN gene.
