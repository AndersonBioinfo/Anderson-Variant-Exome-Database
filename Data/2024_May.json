This variant is a frameshift variant which occurs in an exon of PCDH15 upstream where nonsense mediated decay is predicted to occur. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation.\nPopulation frequency: This variant has not been reported in gnomAD database and 1000 genomes database.\nClinical and Literature evidence: Another stop gained variant in the same amino acid position (p.Tyr579Ter) has been previously classified as pathogenic in ClinVar database for autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss 23 [3]. This variant has been previously reported in patients affected with Usher syndrome in compound heterozygous state [4].\nIn-silico prediction: The reference codon is conserved across mammals in PhyloP and GERP++ tools.\nOMIM phenotype: Deafness, autosomal recessive 23 (OMIM#609533) is caused by homozygous mutation in the PCDH15 gene (OMIM*605514). Usher syndrome, type 1F (OMIM#602083) and Usher syndrome, type 1D/F digenic (OMIM#601067) are caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the PCDH15 gene (OMIM*605514). Usher syndrome type I is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by profound congenital hearing impairment with unintelligible speech, early retinitis pigmentosa (usually evident within the first decade), and constant vestibular dysfunction. Type I is distinguished from type II (276901) on the basis of severity of hearing loss and the extent of vestibular involvement. Type I patients are profoundly deaf, whereas type II patients are 'hard of hearing.' Vestibular function is defective in type I patients, whereas type II patients have normal vestibular function. Patients with type III (USH3; 276902) have progressive hearing loss. Usher syndrome constitutes a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by progressive pigmentary retinopathy and sensorineural hearing loss. Phenotypic distinctions are based on auditory and vestibular differences. Persons with forms of Usher syndrome type Transient bullous of the newborn (OMIM#131705)",
