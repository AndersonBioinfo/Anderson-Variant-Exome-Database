Molecular karyotyping in Product of conception of last miscarriage was indicative of Trisomy 14. Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Aneuploidy (PGT-A) in 4 embryos (ART conception with donor oocyte) was indicative of aneuploidies. Mr. Vasanth Kumar's Whole Exome Sequencing revealed autosomal recessive heterozygous likely pathogenic variants c.670C>T in CTC1 gene causative of cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts and c.1201G>A in TMPRSS3 gene causative of Deafness, autosomal recessive 8/10. Both the partners karyotype was indicative of normal chromosome complement. Semen analysis in male partner revealed Asthenoteratozoospermia and has high DFI. Male partner's maternal uncle has congenital mutism and paternal uncle’s two sons passed away at 11 years of age, female partner’s parents are of consanguineous marriage, her paternal aunt has breast cancer and another paternal aunt succumbed to uterine cancer. Mr. Vasanth Kumar and donor of Mrs. Vedha has been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations",

Couple carrier screening by Whole Exome Sequencing (done elsewhere, 2024) revealed both partners are carriers for 3 variants of uncertain significance-GLB1:c.1479G>T, PEX7:c.508T>G, PIEZO1: c.6973A>G (autosomal recessive conditions). Additionally, Mr. Chaitanya was found to be a carrier for 2 likely pathogenic variants- DNAH7: c.1519C>T, FANCI: c.1789C>T (autosomal recessive conditions) and Mrs. Keerthi Kiran was found to be a carrier for a likely pathogenic variant KCNJ16: c.526C>T (autosomal recessive condition). Mr. Y Chaitanya Krishna and Mrs. B. Keerthi Kiran have been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations.",

Mrs. Naskath Begum and her partner's karyotype was indicative of normal chromosome complement. Mrs. Naskath Begum was born to third degree consanguineous parents. She has an ongoing pregnancy and USG at 12 weeks 2 days indicative of normal findings. The fetus of Mrs. Naskath Begum has been evaluated for pathogenic variations.",

      "Human Reference Genome": "Mrs. Alagu Meena is of second degree consanguineous marriage and presented with bad obstetric history. Her first born female baby presented with complaints of recurrent fever, respiratory tract infection and loose stools. At 1 year 9 months X-ray showed cardiomegaly, Echo suggestive of congestive cardiac failure with low ejection fraction -25% and global hypokinesia of left ventricle, CT showed hepatomegaly pleural effusion, pancreatitis with peri pancreatic fluid collection. The baby succumbed to illness due to sudden cardiac arrest. Her second born female baby presented with chief complaints of recurrent episode of fever from 6 months of age and abnormal movements of the upper limb, MRI brain indicative of mild thinning of corpus callosum, bilateral symmetrical changes involving both sides of thalami, midbrain, basal ganglia and periventricular region - suggestive of Leigh's disease. At 8 months of age baby succumbed to illness due to respiratory distress. Mrs. Alagu Meena's Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial encephalopathy panel genes (done elsewhere;2017) revealed an autosomal recessive heterozygous variant of uncertain significance - c.652C>C/T in ALG1 gene causative of congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ik and c.2952G>G/C in AARS2 gene causative of combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-8, progressive leukoencephalopathy with ovarian failure. Sanger sequencing for variants in ALG1 and AARS2 gene (done elsewhere;2017) in male partner revealed he does not harbour the mutations. Mrs.Alagu meena and her husband's karyotype indicative of normal chromosomal complement. Her family history indicative of few childhood deaths of unknown cause. Her USG at 19 weeks 4 days GA indicative of fetal bladder is flanked by single umbilical artery. The fetus of Mrs. Alagu Meena has been evaluated for pathogenic variations.",
