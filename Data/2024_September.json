Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Aneuploidies in two ART cycles with self-gametes revealed all embryos were aneuploid. Mr. Kumar Basu is diagnosed with hypertension, and his father and paternal grandfather (succumbed) were diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma. The couple opted for ART cycle with donor oocyte. Comprehensive carrier screening in the male Mr. Kumar Basu revealed heterozygous carrier of likely pathogenic variants in GNB5 gene (p.Arg21Ter), PMFBP1 gene (p.Glu300Ter), SLC10A2 gene (c.919+1G>A), SLC26A2 gene (p.Thr661AsnfsTer15) and FSIP2 gene (p.Glu1747del).
