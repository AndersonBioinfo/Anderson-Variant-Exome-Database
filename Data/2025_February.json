Their son, Master Mohammad Daniyal presented with a history of seizures, developmental delay, and learning difficulties. During the first six months of life, he experienced feeding difficulties due to a thin esophagus, requiring reconstructive surgery at 10 months of age. Following the surgery, he developed seizures that recurred over 10 days, after which he was started on anti-seizure medications. Chromosomal microarray analysis (done elsewhere; 2024) revealed a normal chromosomal complement but identified multiple regions of homozygosity (ranging from 14.5 to 33.7 Mb) across chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6, 13, 18, and 22, suggesting a potential autosomal recessive etiology. Fragile X screening (done elsewhere; 2024) showed a CGG repeat size of 29, which falls within the normal range. Whole exome sequencing (AND24100003575; 2025) for Master. Mohammed Daniyal revealed heterozygous variant of uncertain significance c.511C>G in the CSNK2A1 gene and homozygous variant of uncertainsignificance c.1928A>G in LZTR1 gene. Their female child has thalassemia trait. Mr. Iltiaf Hussain and Mrs. \nZainab Bano have been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations.",

      "Clinical History": "Mr. Muzeeb and Mrs. Sumiya are third-degree consanguineous couple with a bad obstetric history. Their first\nborn female child's antenatal scan revealed ?mild intrauterine growth restriction and steroids for lung \ndevelopment were administered. She was born full term via LSCS, weighed 3.06 kgs, and cried immediately \nafter birth. She was admitted to NICU due to tachypnea. She presented with decreased movement in upper \nlimbs and no movements of lower limbs at 2 months of age. MLPA for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (Done \nelsewhere) in the index child revealed a homozygous deletion in exon 7 in the telomeric copy of the SMN1 \ngene. She succumbed at 5 months of age due to pneumonia. MLPA for Spinal Muscular Atrophy done for both \nthe partners [AND23590021651 and AND23590021652, 2024] revealed they are heterozygous for deletion in \nexon 7 and 8 in the SMN1 gene. Peripheral Blood Karyotyping in both partners was indicative of normal \nchromosome complement. Mrs. Sumiya is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Mr. Muzeeb's paternal cousin \nwas suspected of intellectual disability and succumbed at 20 years of age. Mrs. Sumiya's maternal aunt is \ndiagnosed with polio and her maternal cousin is suspected of mild speech delay. Whole Exome Sequencing in the partners revealed [AND23590021651; AND23590021652, 2024] the couple are \nheterozygous carriers for two likely pathogenic variants CCDC40: c.2787_2802del; KRT83: c.811delA; and a \nvariant of uncertain significance SLC24A1: c.1901G>A. Additionally, Mr. Muzeeb is heterozygous carrier for \nfive likely pathogenic variants CASQ2: c.98G>A; MLC1: c.714+1G>A; GPR179: c.3594_3595delAG; RP1L1: \nc.608delA; TCTN3: c.737-1G>T. The couple are planning for ART conception with donor oocyte. MLPA for Spinal \nMuscular Atrophy in the donor of Mrs. Sumiya (Sultana) [AND241H0001426, 2025] revealed a heterozygous \nvariant of uncertain significance duplication of exon 8 in the SMN1 gene. The donor of Mrs. Sumiya (Sultana) \nhas been evaluated for pathogenic variations. ",
