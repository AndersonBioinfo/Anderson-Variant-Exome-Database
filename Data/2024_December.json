Her investigations showed ankle clonus is present, thenar wasting is present, right upper limb more than left, all DTR exaggerated, Hoffman ++. Her VEP report indicative of normal VEP on both sides. Her CSF analysis showed TC 2, PMN 0, MN 2, glucose 57, protein 23, ADA 3.7, GeneXpert not detected. Her EMG indicative of positive fasciculation and neurogenic pattern. Her MRI - brain with diffusion with contrast indicative of no significant abnormality in the brain parenchyma, mild straightening of cervical spine seen and there is evidence of small well defined rounded t1/t2 hyperintense lesion measuring 3*3mm in T4 vertebral body, likely suggestive of small lipohemangioma. Her MRI - cervical spine contrast indicative of no significant abnormalities detected and her NCS study indicative of bilateral ulnar CMAPs - mild decrease in amplitude - rest of the study within normal limits. Her NCS study (2024) suggestive of motor axonal involvement of the ulnar innervated muscles. Her ANA and parancoplastic neurologic syndrome - IgG by LIA (12 antigen test) are negative. Her needle electromyography shows evidence of neurogenic pattern in right deltoid and bilateral first dorsal interrosei(R>L) muscles. Her NCS/EMG/EP report indicative of SEEP latencies are within normal limits in both upper and lower limbs and P300 latencies are within normal limits. Proband's father has polio attack at 12 years of age with right hand and leg paralysed. She is married non-consanguineous, has a daughter, alive and well. Proband, Mrs. Porselvi N is suspected to be affected motor neuron disease ?ALS and has been evaluated for pathogenic variations",

His First: Standford Binet Intelligence Scale 5th edition indicative of total intelligence degree of 62, which makes him within the category of intelligence (mildy impaired or delayed). His newborn screening panel (done elsewhere; 2018) was indicative of screen negative, Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (done elsewhere) showed no copy number variations and his karyotyping showed normal male chromosome complement. His FISH analysis (done elsewhere) was indicative of 8.3% cells with three copies of chromosome 21, Trisomy 21 low mosaicDown syndrome. Both partner's karyotype showed normal chromosome complement and targeted testing in \nboth for the variant c.773T>C in LMX1B gene identified in Baby. Mahdiya indicative of both does not harbour \nthe variant identified. Female partner’s father succumbed to kidney failure and her paternal niece has \ncongenital leg defect. Male partner’s paternal cousin brother succumbed to pancreatic cancer, paternal \nnephew has autistic features and maternal cousin brother succumbed to ?oral cancer.

Mrs. Nandini M and Mr. Nishanth Goud have been evaluated for carrier status of pathogenic variations.",
